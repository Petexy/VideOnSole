# Set the version this project releases under.

# `VERSION` at the root of the checkout is that number, and most things read it
# where it stands: the Arch, Debian and Nix definitions, and the source
# archive's name.
#
# Three places cannot read a file and carry the number as a literal instead.
# Cargo's manifest is one: `videonsole --version` prints CARGO_PKG_VERSION, so
# that manifest is where a running program says what it is. The Fedora spec is
# the second, because `Version:` has to be a literal for the spec to be one
# anyone could submit. The AppStream release list is the third, because it is
# not only a version — it is the entry every other software centre reads to say
# what this release changed, and only a person can write that half.
#
# This writes all of them, which is what makes a release one command rather
# than four edits that have to agree.

Writes the version into VERSION, [package] in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock,
packaging/fedora/videonsole.spec and the AppStream release list. Every other
package definition reads VERSION for itself.

Run with the version already in VERSION to write the other four back into
agreement with it.
