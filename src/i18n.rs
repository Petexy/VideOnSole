//! The words themselves are in `locales/`, one Fluent catalog per language,
//! compiled into the binary; the machinery that reads them is the toolkit's,
//! so an application, the file question it raises and the shell it was opened
//! from all speak from catalogs of the same shape. See
//! `docs/localization.md`, and `lxb_toolkit::i18n` for how a language is
//! chosen.
//!
//! Anything a person, a device or a file gave its name to is passed as a
//! *value* and never as an identifier: a message id is this application's own
//! writing, and a file called `{ $name }.png` is still a file.
