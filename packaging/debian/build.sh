Usage: packaging/debian/build.sh [--output-dir DIR] [--allow-foreign-host]

Builds the Debian binary package from the current working tree. A deployable
package must be built on Debian (or a Debian derivative) so its ABI and
generated shared-library dependencies match the target system.

--allow-foreign-host is for looking at the package's shape on another
distribution. It is not a way to produce something installable there.

# Everything the build needs is checked here, before anything is compiled, and
# all of it at once. A bare Debian container has none of it, and meeting the
# gaps one per attempt — the packaging tools, then Rust, then each library a
# minute into a release build — is how a first build takes an afternoon. Each
# gap is named by the Debian package that fills it, so the refusal is one apt
# line.
#
# The libraries are the ones this build links: probed through pkg-config by a
# -sys crate, or named by a #[link] attribute. What the program only opens at
# run time is not a build's business, and is not refused over.
#
# Rust is rustup rather than Debian's cargo package, which is 1.85 on Debian 13
# and older than the locked dependency graph allows. rustup's proxies go in
# /usr/bin, and in a distrobox or toolbox they find the toolchain already in
# the shared ~/.rustup.
