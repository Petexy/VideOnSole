# This deliberately does not install the licence or any documentation. Where

# Fedora want /usr/share/licenses, Debian wants a copyright file under
# /usr/share/doc — so each recipe places its own and this stays the part they
# can all share.

Usage: packaging/install.sh --destdir DIR [--prefix PREFIX]
                            [--target-dir DIR] [--binary FILE]

Stages Videonsole into DESTDIR. PREFIX defaults to /usr and --target-dir to
CARGO_TARGET_DIR or ./target; --binary names the executable outright, for a
builder that has put it somewhere neither of those describes.

  bin/videonsole
  share/applications/videonsole.desktop
  share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/videonsole.svg
  share/metainfo/io.github.petexy.videonsole.metainfo.xml

There is no --libdir and no --component. This installs no library, so there is
nothing for a multiarch triplet to disambiguate; and it is one package on every
distribution, because splitting a single executable from its own desktop entry
would produce a package that installs and then cannot be started.
